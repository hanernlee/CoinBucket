## Technologies
1. Swift
2. Nimble & Quick using Carthage
3. CoinMarketCap API

## Background
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency has been making headlines for the most of 2017 and I figured it would be good to get my feet wet by combining both my interest in iOS development together with cryptocurrencies. Having invested in some of these coins, I found myself having to check prices of these crypto coins constantly and that was when I decided to create this app for my personal use. At the moment, the app is powered using CoinMarketCap's API which has over 1400 coins and support for 31 different currencies.

## Thoughts & Challenges
Having no prior iOS development experience and being self-taught, building this app was definitely a challenge. I opted to code everything programatically as compared to using storyboards to see the difference. As a Web Developer, I felt comfortable coding everything from scratch but for my next App I would definitely love to combine both techniques where necessary.

# To-Dos
At this stage, I am still not happy enough for it to be published on the AppStore. There is still a whole lot of features to be added and I am definitely working towards it.

# Final Thoughts
After diving into iOS development, I can confidently say that I am in love and super passionate about iOS development. Just can't wait to learn more throughout this journey.

*Future features
1. Ability to add Coins to Portfolio
2. Nightmode ability
3. Fluid animations and better design (Better UX/UI)
