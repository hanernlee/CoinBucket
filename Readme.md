## Version
v2.0

## Background
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency has been making headlines for the most of 2017 and I figured it would be good to get my feet wet by combining both my interest in iOS development together with cryptocurrencies. Having invested in some of these coins, I found myself having to check prices of these crypto coins constantly and that was when I decided to create this app for my personal use. At the moment, the app is powered using cryptocompare's API which has over 5,600 coins and support for different currencies.

## Thoughts & Challenges
Having no prior iOS development experience and being self-taught, building this app was definitely a challenge.
