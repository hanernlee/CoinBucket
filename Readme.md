## Version
v1.2

## Technologies
1. Swift
2. https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

## Background
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency has been making headlines for the most of 2017 and I figured it would be good to get my feet wet by combining both my interest in iOS development together with cryptocurrencies. Having invested in some of these coins, I found myself having to check prices of these crypto coins constantly and that was when I decided to create this app for my personal use. At the moment, the app is powered using coinmarketcap's API which has over 1400 coins and support for 31 different currencies.

## Thoughts & Challenges
Having no prior iOS development experience and being self-taught, building this app was definitely a challenge. I opted to code everything programatically as compared to using storyboards to see the difference and to understand how UIKit works under the hood. 

As a Web Developer, I felt comfortable coding everything from scratch but for my next App I would definitely love to combine both techniques of using Storyboards and coding UI programmatically where necessary.

### Update

### Final Thoughts
After diving into iOS development, I can confidently say that I am in love and super passionate about the iOS environment. Just can't wait to learn more throughout this journey.
